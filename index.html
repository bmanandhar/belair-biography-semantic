      , born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chilling out</li>
      <li>Maxing</li>
      <li>Relaxing, all cool</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys &mdash; they were up to <a href="#"><b>no good</b></a> &mdash; started making trouble in my neighorhood.</p>
    <div class="image">
    <img src="bball.jpg" height="150"/>
  </div>
    <p>I got in one <i>little fight</i> and my mom got scared. She said,
    <blockquote>"You'll move in with your Auntie and your Uncle in Bel-Air."</blockquote></p>
